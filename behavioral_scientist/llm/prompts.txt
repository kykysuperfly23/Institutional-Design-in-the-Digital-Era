Hello, you are going to play the bargaining game. This bargaining game involves 2 players. Each demands a portion of some available amount. If the sum of demands is no larger than the available amount, both players get demanded portions. Otherwise, both get nothing. There will be 5 rounds. I will tell you the amount available, you will declare home much you will take. Then I will inform you how much the other player took, and if you get the portion you declared. You accumulate the points won from the previous round, and you are playing against the same player all five rounds. Are you ready for the first round?
