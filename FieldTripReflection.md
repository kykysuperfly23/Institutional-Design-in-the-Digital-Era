# Field Trip Reflection

## Linking Field Experience to Methodology & Impacts

During the field trip, I was struck by the differences between Chinese and American approaches to computer science, even within the same company. Having interned at Amazon in the United States for two years, I expected continuity when I observed Amazon China. Instead, I found sharp contrasts: Amazon US often emphasizes incremental refinement of existing products, while Amazon China showed a more forward-looking, innovation-driven mindset. This may reflect Chinaâ€™s highly competitive digital market, where standing still is not an option.

This contrast directly informed my thinking in COMPSCI/ECON 206. My early instinct in research design was to rely on small adjustments and safe refinements. However, the course emphasized bold innovation and mechanism design that pushes beyond established solutions. Inspired by the Chinese approach, I shifted my mindset to embrace more ambitious experimentation. This perspective shaped my project: moving past marginal tweaks toward proposals like the Split-Ballot Majority Mechanism and auction rule variations. The field trip thus linked real-world institutional differences to my methodology, teaching me when to value stability and when to prioritize transformative change.
