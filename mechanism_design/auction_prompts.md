# Unqiue/Less Unique Auction Bid Prompts
## Prompt 1
You are competing against the 19 other students in your class. Each of you will choose a number (integer) between 1 and 100. The choices made will then be ordered from the highest to the lowest. Any number chosen by more than one student will be "crossed out". The student who chose the highest number among those remaining will win a (virtual) prize. What number do you choose?

## Prompt 2
You are competing against the 19 other students in your class. Each of you will choose a number (integer) between 1 and 100. The choices made will then be ordered from the highest to the lowest. Any number chosen by more than three students will be "crossed out". The student who chose the highest number among those remaining will win a (virtual) prize. If that highest number has been selected by 2 or 3 students, a student will be randomly selected from the group to receive the prize. What number do you choose?
