# Institutional Design in the Digital Era: Re-Examining Microeconomics with Human Subjects and Artificial Agents

## 📑 Project Abstract
This project explores how mechanism design can be tested through a combination of theoretical game analysis, computational simulations, human experiments, and large language model (LLM) play. Focusing on bargaining problems, highest unique bid (HUB) auctions, and voting innovations (the Split-Ballot Majority Mechanism), the study highlights how institutional rules shape outcomes and legitimacy. Results emphasize the multiplicity of equilibria, bounded rationality in human play, and adaptive strategies in LLMs, offering forward-looking proposals for fairer and more transparent governance mechanisms.  

## 👩‍💻 Authors and Roles
- **Kyaira Boughton**  
  - *Economist*: Theoretical analysis of bargaining problems, fairness benchmarks (Nash Bargaining Solution, Kalai–Smorodinsky).  
  - *Computational Scientist*: Equilibrium computation with Python (NashPy, QuantEcon), Game Theory Explorer (GTE) outputs.  
  - *Behavioral Scientist*: Human experiments using oTree; comparison to LLM behavior (ChatGPT, Claude).  
  - *Mechanism Designer*: Development of the Split-Ballot Majority Mechanism and auction variations.  

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This repository supports the final research proposal submitted to **COMPSCI/ECON 206: Computational Microeconomics**, instructed by Prof. Luyao Zhang at Duke Kunshan University in Autumn 2025.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
Special thanks to **Professor Luyao Zhang** for guidance, the class of COMPSCI 206, and the specific classmates **Yihan Chen** and **Zijun Ding** for constructive feedback. I also acknowledge the contributions of AIGC tools (ChatGPT, Claude) for assistance in grammar and formatting, and the open-source communities behind **NashPy**, **QuantEcon**, **GTE**, and **oTree**, as well as **GitHub** for ensuring reproducibility and transparency.

## 🌱 Statement of Intellectual and Professional Growth
This project enhanced my ability to design and execute interdisciplinary research. By integrating theoretical economics, computational methods, and experimental design, I developed stronger skills in reproducibility, open-source collaboration, and critical reflection on fairness and legitimacy in mechanism design. Professionally, I learned to respond to critiques, format research proposals, and leverage platforms like oTree and GitHub as tools for rigorous social science.
